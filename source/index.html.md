# Introduction

The peach API is categorized in two parts: Public and private API endpoints.

All market data, that is publicly available can be accessed without API credentials.

Private data, which is user specific can only be accessed by using an auth token. The auth token can be acquired by presenting the public key (user id) and a message + signature associated with the public key.

## Rate Limiting

Limits are applied IP-Address and point based.

A client receives 10 points per second. Each endpoint has a weight assigned which will be used to substract from the client's budget.

Should all points be used up, the API will return a `429 'Too Many Requests'`.
